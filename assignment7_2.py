"""
Create a class called RationalNumber for performing arithmetic with fractions.
(Write a driver program to test your class.)
Use integer variables to represent the data of the classâ€”the numerator and the
denominator. Provide a constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialised
when it is declared. The constructor should contain default values, in case no initializers
are provided, and should store the fraction in reduced form (i.e., the fraction
2/4
would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator). Provide
methods for each of the following:
a) Adding two RationalNumbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
b) Subtracting two RationalNumbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
c) Multiplying two RationalNumbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
d) Dividing two RationalNumbers. The result should be stored in reduced form.
e) Printing RationalNumbers in the form a/b, where a is the numerator and b is the
denominator.
f) Printing RationalNumbers in floating-point format.
